# Anubis .NET Agent — Usage Guide

## How to Invoke Anubis

### Via Copilot CLI Command

```bash
# Interactive agent selection
copilot -agent

# Or direct invocation
copilot task Anubis --prompt "Review this code..."

# With file input
copilot task Anubis < my-code.cs

# With configuration override
copilot task Anubis --model claude-3-5-sonnet --prompt "..."
```

### Via GitHub Copilot Chat (if available)

```
@Anubis review my service layer for security issues
```

## Typical Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Input

Gather the code and context you want Anubis to review:

```bash
# Single file
cat src/Services/PaymentService.cs

# Multiple files with context
cat src/Models/Payment.cs src/Services/PaymentService.cs

# Entire project summary (if small)
find src -name "*.cs" -type f -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -rn | head -10
```

### Step 2: Invoke Anubis with Context

```bash
copilot task Anubis --prompt "
Code Review Request:

Project: E-commerce Payment System
Objective: Security audit of payment processing layer
Files: PaymentService.cs, PaymentValidator.cs, PaymentRepository.cs

Key context:
- Uses Entity Framework Core 8.0
- Azure SQL Database backend
- PCI-DSS compliance required
- Currently processing $10M+ annually

Please review for:
1. SQL injection / parameterization
2. Secure credential handling
3. Transaction safety
4. Error logging (no sensitive data leakage)
5. Architectural fit with domain model

Include severity ranking and concrete refactoring proposals.
"
```

### Step 3: Review Findings

Anubis returns structured report:

```
📋 ANUBIS CODE REVIEW REPORT

Project: E-commerce Payment System
Files Analyzed: 3
Total Lines: 847

SEVERITY SUMMARY
├─ Critical: 1
├─ High: 2
├─ Medium: 4
└─ Low: 2

KEY FINDINGS

[Critical] SQL Injection Risk
File: PaymentRepository.cs:42
Issue: String concatenation in SQL query
Recommendation: Use parameterized EF Core queries

[High] Hardcoded Connection String
File: PaymentService.cs:15
Issue: ConnectionString in appsettings (no encryption)
Recommendation: Move to Key Vault, use managed identity

REFACTORING PROPOSALS

1. Parameterize all EF Core queries
   Impact: Eliminates SQL injection class
   Effort: Low
   
2. Extract secrets to Azure Key Vault
   Impact: PCI-DSS compliance
   Effort: Medium

ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS
✓ Repository pattern correctly isolated
✓ Service layer provides good abstraction
⚠ Payment validation missing input range checks

HANDOFF RECOMMENDATION
Consider Anubis-Runtime if performance profiling needed for high-volume transactions.
```

### Step 4: Optional Handoff

If Anubis identifies issues that need specialized analysis:

```bash
# Handoff to Anubis-devops for pipeline security
copilot task Anubis-devops --prompt "
Based on code review findings from Anubis, 
audit our Azure DevOps pipeline for:
1. Secret exposure in logs
2. Artifact signing
3. Deployment approval gates
..."

# Handoff to Anubis-Runtime for performance
copilot task Anubis-Runtime --prompt "
E-commerce payment service processes 10M transactions/year.
Profile for:
- N+1 query patterns in PaymentRepository
- Transaction deadlock risks
- Memory allocation in payment processing
..."
```

## Configuration Options

Edit `~/.copilot/agents/Anubis.agent.md` to customize:

```yaml
# Model override
#model: "claude-3-5-sonnet"

# Severity threshold (minimum to report)
# Uncomment and adjust as needed:
# #min_severity: "medium"  # Skip "low" severity issues

# Focus areas (comma-separated)
# #focus: "security,architecture,performance"

# Output format
# #output_format: "json"  # or "markdown", "html"
```

Command-line overrides:

```bash
copilot task Anubis \

  --prompt "Review code for security" \
  --config '{"min_severity": "high"}'
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- **Provide clear context** — project type, frameworks, compliance requirements
- **Specify review focus** — security, architecture, performance, or quality
- **Include known issues** — helps Anubis prioritize and correlate findings
- **Provide architecture blueprint** — helps validate layering and boundaries
- **Iterate** — review findings, refactor, request follow-up review

### ❌ DON'T

- **Review without context** — vague requests yield generic feedback
- **Mix multiple systems** — separate reviews for different codebases
- **Expect refactored code** — Anubis proposes, doesn't implement automatically
- **Ignore severity distribution** — prioritize critical and high findings first
- **Combine with pipeline review** — if pipeline is focus, use Anubis-devops first

## Example Prompts

### Security Audit
```
Security Review Request:

Project: Healthcare API
Files: AuthService.cs, PatientService.cs, EncryptionHelper.cs

Compliance: HIPAA
Requirements:
- No hardcoded secrets
- Input validation on all external endpoints
- Secure password handling (bcrypt/Argon2)
- Audit logging without PII

Focus: Security vulnerabilities, cryptographic best practices
```

### Architecture Validation
```
Architecture Review Request:

Project: Microservices Platform
Architecture: Domain-Driven Design with Repository pattern
Files: [list of critical service files]

Expected Layers:
- API Controllers
- Application Services
- Domain Models
- Infrastructure/Repository

Validate:
- Layer separation and dependencies
- Entity/ValueObject boundaries
- Bounded context integrity
```

### Quality & Maintainability
```
Code Quality Review:

Project: Legacy .NET Framework upgrade to .NET 8
Objective: Identify modernization opportunities
Files: [list]

Review for:
- Modern C# features (records, nullable, async/await)
- LINQ vs imperative patterns
- Test coverage and testability
- Performance hot spots
```

## Limitations & Known Issues

- **Large codebases** (>10k LOC per file): May timeout; split into multiple reviews
- **Binary analysis**: Provide source code for best results
- **Third-party integrations**: Requires code context or documentation
- **Async/await patterns**: Best results with realistic scenarios, not synthetic examples
